For the tamil example:

Use iNLTK to predict the next n-words and get similar sentences. IE: “It’s been a while since we last met” in Tamil, predicts the sequential sequence that corresponds and responds in Tamil “And, because of this”; just an example, but a plethora of phrases it will respond with given that. And, all the phrases will remain in Tamil.
